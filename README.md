# Signature Recognition: CNN vs. HOG & SIFT Feature Extraction

## Overview  
This project implements **Signature Recognition** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **manual feature extraction techniques (HOG, SIFT)**. The goal is to **classify signatures** based on different individuals and compare **CNN-based feature extraction vs. traditional techniques**.

## Key Objectives  
- **Segment signatures** into separate folders per individual  
- **Perform train-test split** for model evaluation  
- **Train CNN for signature classification**  
- **Compare CNN features with manual feature extraction (HOG and SIFT)**  
- **Evaluate models using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy**  
- **Analyze performance through error plots & visualizations**
