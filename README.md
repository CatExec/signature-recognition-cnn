# Signature Recognition CNN

Welcome to the Signature Recognition CNN repository, where we delve into the world of deep learning to develop a system for signature classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Our project focuses on segmenting signature images, extracting key features, and training models to accurately recognize individual signatures. We evaluate the system's performance based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Classification**: The system classifies signature images using advanced deep learning techniques.
- **Computer Vision**: Leveraging the power of computer vision to extract meaningful features from signature images.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing HOG and SIFT for robust feature extraction from signature images.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Employing pattern recognition algorithms to identify unique characteristics of signatures.
- **PyTorch and TensorFlow**: Implementing the system with PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks for efficient training and inference.
